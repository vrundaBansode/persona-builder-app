# AI Persona & Product-Market Fit Engine üöÄ

## Instantly understand customer demands and accelerate your product development with AI-driven insights for early founders and small business owners.

This application is an **ongoing project** and currently represents its **initial development phase**. We are continuously working to enhance its features, accuracy, and user experience.

This engine leverages the power of Google's Gemini and Imagen models to provide a comprehensive suite of tools designed to help founders and small business owners deeply understand their target customers, craft compelling messaging, identify critical problem-solution fits, and even define who _not_ to target.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Limitations & Future Work

- **Persona Builder (Under Development):** The "Persona Builder" tab is explicitly marked as "Coming Soon" and its core functionality is not yet active in this version.
- **AI Model Consistency:** While prompts are optimized, AI models can sometimes generate responses that require slight manual adjustments or re-generation. We are continuously refining prompts for greater consistency.
- **Image Generation Quotas/Latency:** Image generation via Imagen may be subject to API quotas and can sometimes experience latency.
- **Refinement Iterations:** Advanced iterative refinement of generated content is an area for future improvement.
- **Comprehensive Data Handling:** While CSV upload is supported, more robust data validation and error handling for diverse data inputs will be implemented.
- **Scalability:** This initial prototype is designed for individual use and small business scenarios. Features for larger-scale operations will be considered in future phases.

## üõ†Ô∏è Setup and Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- A Google Cloud Project with billing enabled.
- Access to Google Gemini API (part of Google Cloud's Generative AI offerings).
- Access to Google Imagen model (usually through Vertex AI or Generative Language API).

### API Key Configuration

1.  **Obtain your API Key:**

    - Go to the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/).
    - Navigate to **APIs & Services > Credentials**.
    - Create or select an existing API key.
    - Ensure the API key has access to the necessary Google Generative AI services (e.g., Vertex AI API, Generative Language API).

2.  **Set Environment Variable:**
    The application reads the API key from an environment variable named `GEMINI_API_key`.

    **For Windows:**

    ```bash
    set GEMINI_API_key=YOUR_API_KEY_HERE
    ```

    **For macOS/Linux:**

    ```bash
    export GEMINI_API_key=YOUR_API_KEY_HERE
    ```

    Replace `YOUR_API_KEY_HERE` with your actual API key. For persistent setting, you might add this to your `.bashrc`, `.zshrc`, or system environment variables.

### Installation Steps

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone <repository_url>
    cd persona-builder-app
    ```

    (Replace `<repository_url>` with the actual URL of your repository.)

2.  **Create and activate a virtual environment:**

    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    # On Windows:
    venv\Scripts\activate
    # On macOS/Linux:
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```

3.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

---

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to Run the Application

Once the setup is complete and your `GEMINI_API_key` environment variable is set:

1.  **Open your terminal or command prompt.**
2.  **Navigate to the project's root directory** (where `trial.py` and `requirements.txt` are located).
3.  **Ensure your virtual environment is activated.**
4.  **Run the Streamlit application:**
    ```bash
    streamlit run trial.py
    ```
5.  The application will automatically open in your default web browser at `localhost:8501` (or another available port).

    As a highly skilled UX researcher and marketing strategist, your task is to synthesize a detailed customer persona based on the provided customer feedback (text) and any additional visual context (image, if provided). The image should inform the persona's context, environment, or aesthetic preferences.

    The persona should be returned in a strict JSON format with the following keys:
    - 'name': A creative, memorable name for this persona (e.g., "Sarah the Savvy Shopper").
    - 'archetype': A concise, descriptive archetype (e.g., "The Budget-Conscious Student", "The Tech-Averse Senior").
    - 'motivations': A list of 3-5 primary goals or what drives their decisions.
    - 'pain_points': A list of 3-5 key frustrations or challenges they face, especially related to products/services.
    - 'aspirations': A list of 2-3 things they hope to achieve or become.
    - 'typical_scenario': A short narrative (2-4 sentences) describing a typical day or a common interaction they have related to the product/service, integrating visual cues if an image was provided.
    - 'visual_avatar_description': A textual description (1-2 sentences) suitable for generating an image that represents this persona, highly informed by the overall persona attributes and the provided image.

    Customer Feedback (Text):
    \"\"\"
    {feedback_text}
    \"\"\"

    Ensure the entire response is a single, valid JSON object. Do not include any introductory or concluding remarks outside the JSON.

# --- Instructions for Running ---
st.sidebar.header("How to Run This App")
st.sidebar.markdown("""
1.  **Save the code:** Save the above code as `app.py` in your project folder.
2.  **Set API Key:** Ensure your Gemini API key is set as an environment variable named `GEMINI_API_KEY` in the terminal you're using.
3.  **Run the app:**
    * Open your terminal/command prompt.
    * Navigate to your project folder (`cd persona_builder_app`).
    * Ensure your `venv` is active (`source venv/bin/activate` or `.\venv\Scripts\activate`).
    * Run the Streamlit command:
        ```bash
        streamlit run app.py
        ```
4.  **Interact:** A new tab will open in your web browser with the app. Provide text feedback, optionally upload an image, and click "Generate Persona."
""")

st.sidebar.header("Prioritization & Optimization Notes")
st.sidebar.markdown("""
* **Functionality First:** This initial version focuses on getting the core AI generation working.
* **API Key Security:** Using environment variables is crucial for security.
* **Error Handling:** Basic error handling is included for API calls and JSON parsing.
* **UI Simplicity:** Streamlit makes the UI simple; no complex CSS/HTML is required for core functionality.
* **Future Optimizations (Next Steps):**
    * **Persistent Storage:** Integrate Firebase Firestore to save/retrieve generated personas.
    * **Rate Limiting/Cost Management:** For real-world use, implement mechanisms to control API calls.
    * **Advanced UI:** More sophisticated layouts, search/filter for stored personas.
    * **Direct Image Generation:** Integrate a separate text-to-image model (like Imagen on Vertex AI or Stability AI) to actually generate the avatar image from the `visual_avatar_description`.
    * **User Authentication:** For a multi-user environment.
